This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK. The build process fails with the following error message:

`FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.
* What went wrong: 
Execution failed for task ':app:processDebugGoogleServices'.
> File google-services.json is missing. The Google Services Plugin cannot function without it.`,

This usually happens when the `google-services.json` file is missing from the `android/app/` directory of your project.
