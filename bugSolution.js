The solution is to download the `google-services.json` file from your Firebase project and place it in the `android/app/` directory of your Expo project.  This file contains configuration information necessary for Google Services integration.

Here is how to reproduce the error and fix it:

1. **Reproduce:**  Create a new Expo project and attempt to build an Android APK without adding the `google-services.json` file.
2. **Fix:** Download `google-services.json` from your Firebase project console and place it in `android/app/`.  Then run the Expo build process again.
